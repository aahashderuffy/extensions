### Contributor License Agreements (CLA)

We'd love to accept your code patches! However, before we can take them, we 
have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License 
Agreement.

* If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you 
own the intellectual property, then accept an [CLA](http://iscinc.github.io/cla/).

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and 
instructions for how to sign and return it.

1. Accept the contributors license agreement above.
2. Decide which code you want to submit. A submission should be a set of changes
that addresses one issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/iSCInc/extensions/issues).
Please don't mix more than one logical change per submission, because it makes
the history hard to follow. If you want to make a change
(e.g. add a sample or feature) that doesn't have a corresponding issue in the
issue tracker, please create one.
3. **Submitting**: When you are ready to submit, send us a Pull Request. Be
sure to include the issue number you've fixed and the name you used to sign
the CLA.
